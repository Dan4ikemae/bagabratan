# Bagabratan - Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Java. The main objective is to provide custom implementations for learning and experimentation with basic data structures such as lists, queues, stacks, heaps, etc.

### Data Structures Implemented:
- **MyArrayList**: A custom implementation of a dynamic array list.
- **MyLinkedList**: A custom doubly linked list implementation.
- **MyStack**: A custom stack using a linked list.
- **MyQueue**: A custom queue using a linked list.
- **MyMinHeap**: A basic min-heap implementation.

### Features:
- Implementations are written in Java.
- Basic operations such as add, remove, set, get, size, clear, and more are provided.
- Sorting algorithms like bubble sort are implemented on custom data structures.

## Structure

- `MyArrayList.java`: Implementation of a dynamic array list.
- `MyLinkedList.java`: Implementation of a doubly linked list.
- `MyList.java`: Interface that defines the basic operations for list-like structures.
- `MyMinHeap.java`: Min-heap data structure.
- `MyQueue.java`: Queue implementation.
- `MyStack.java`: Stack implementation.
- `Main.java`: Example usage of the above data structures.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher

## Usage

To run the example code, simply execute the `Main.java` file in your IDE or via the command line.

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
